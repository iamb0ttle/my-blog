# Overview
*This document summarizes my thoughts on whether the habit of documentation is truly necessary.*


# Introduction
Since 2024, when I began studying software development and seriously reflecting on life, I have maintained a habit of documenting and organizing what Iâ€™ve learned. However, Iâ€™ve encountered several issues in this process:

- I rarely revisit what Iâ€™ve written.
- The time spent documenting detracts from more critical tasks.
- A vast amount of similar information already exists online.

Due to these concerns, over the past year Iâ€™ve repeatedly deleted and recreated my study notes, constantly questioning whether I was heading in the right direction.

To gain clarity, I decided to ask this question to the generative AI model Grok3.


# Conclusion
The generative AI Grok3 provided the following response:

> "You should continue documenting for the sake of cognitive organization and growth tracking. However, you should improve the method to suit your dynamic learning styleâ€”make it concise and personalized. Focus on documenting new concepts or those aligned with your goals. Define criteria to summarize content efficiently at basic (1â€“2 min), intermediate (3â€“5 min), and advanced (5â€“10 min) levels."

<br/>
In essence, documentation is a tool for structuring thought and tracking growth. The act of documentation itself holds valueâ€”not just the resulting notes. I agree with this perspective and have decided to resume documenting my learning process.

However, I established the following rules:

- **The process of documentation is more important than the result.**  
    (This is evident when I still recall the blog posts I wrote in the past.)
- **Focus on concepts that are either not widely available online or are commonly misunderstood (e.g., object-oriented programming, human relationships).**  
    (This improves the efficiency of documentation.)
- **Regularly review past records to continue progressing.**  
    (Failure is the foundation of growth.)



# Final Thoughts
Though I deleted and recreated countless documents, that knowledge was not erased from my mind. Through the act of documentation, I internalized the information. In a way, I was on the right path all along. From now on, I will **never** doubt this approach again.

**Documentation is part of the growth ðŸŒ± process.**
