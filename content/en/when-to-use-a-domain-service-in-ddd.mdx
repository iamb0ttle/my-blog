# Overview
_This document summarizes when to use a Domain Service._

# Introduction
A **Domain Service** in Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is responsible for handling important domain logic that doesn’t naturally fit into an **Entity** or **Value Object** (VO).  
While an **Application Service** coordinates use cases or transaction flows, a **Domain Service** encapsulates significant business rules within the domain model.

If we place business logic inside an Application Service instead of a Domain Service, it can lead to:  
- Reduced cohesion in the domain model  
- Decreased maintainability  
- Increased testing complexity  

Therefore, knowing when to introduce a Domain Service is critical for a clean DDD design. This document explains the key cases where a Domain Service is appropriate.

# Cases That Require a Domain Service
There are three major cases where using a Domain Service is recommended:

1. **Business rules span multiple entities**  
   - When business rules are intertwined across different entities, it’s difficult to keep them within a single domain model.  
   - In this case, moving the logic to a Domain Service improves clarity and maintainability.

2. **Logic feels unnatural inside an entity**  
   - Adding certain rules directly into an entity may blur its responsibility or violate the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**.  
   - Example: Placing an `OrderPolicyDecisionService` inside the Order entity is unnatural — deciding policies isn’t the direct responsibility of the Order itself.

3. **Pure logic without state but still part of the domain**  
   - Sometimes, a domain contains important concepts that consist only of logic, without any persistent state.  
   - Examples include tax calculation, discount policies, or reward point calculations.

# Final Thoughts
Domain Services are just as important as Application Services.  
A skilled DDD designer should carefully decide when to use each, ensuring that business logic is placed where it belongs for better cohesion, maintainability, and testability.
