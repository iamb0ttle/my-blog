# Overview
_This document summarizes the definition of a Domain in DDD._

# Introduction
DDD stands for **Domain-Driven Design**. Therefore, understanding what a domain is becomes essential when applying DDD. Since DDD is a well-structured design approach, many software systems adopt it as a software development methodology. To understand DDD effectively, the first step is to understand the concept of a domain.

This document explains the concept of a domain from the perspective of DDD, along with additional common domain classifications.

# What is the Domain?
In DDD, a **Domain** refers to a specific problem area or subject that needs to be addressed in software development.

For example, if a company needs to develop an auto-information-registration software to eliminate the inconvenience of customers manually writing their information, the company's domain would be “information registration.”

A domain can be considered the primary keyword of the software. Thus, Domain-Driven Design means developing software centered around the domain.

# Additional Domain Types in DDD
In DDD, several types of domains exist:

- **Core Domain**  
  A core domain is the part of the system that provides a competitive edge, differentiation, and unique advantage. It is the most critical domain in your business.  
  _Examples:_ Google’s search engine, Netflix’s content recommendation algorithm, TikTok’s short-form content system.

- **Generic Subdomain**  
  This is a domain area that handles generic functionalities common to many services and does not provide a competitive advantage on its own.  
  _Examples:_ User authentication, email validation, notification systems.

- **Supporting Subdomain**  
  A supporting subdomain assists the core domain’s operation. While it may not offer a direct competitive edge, it is vital for enabling the core domain to function effectively.  
  _Example:_ TikTok’s video upload system — not a competitive differentiator by itself but essential for supporting the video recommendation algorithm (the core domain).

# Final Thoughts
Ultimately, software exists to solve real-world problems. Therefore, defining the domain — the very problem to be solved — is crucial in software development. I have always heard that the domain is important, but through this reflection, I now understand precisely what it is and why it matters.  

In the future, I will design software with careful consideration of the domain.

**A well-designed domain not only improves development productivity but also strengthens business advantages.**
