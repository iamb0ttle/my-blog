# Overview
_This document summarizes concisely DDD terminologies._

# A
- **Aggregate**: Object that binds associated entities and VOs to keep simplicity of domain.
- **Aggregate Root**: Representative entity of an Aggregate. Aggregate state changes are only accessible through the root, which ensures consistency.
- **Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL)**: Layer to protect the consistency and independence between the domain layer and external systems.

# B
- **Bounded Context**: Context that clearly divides the domain area, often aligned to the ubiquitous language.

# C
- **CQRS**: Command Query Responsibility Segregation — separates command and query responsibilities.
- **Context Map**: Diagram that shows interactions and relationships between bounded contexts.
- **Core Domain**: Domain area that gives a business a competitive advantage and contains essential business value (e.g., Google search engine, Netflix recommendation algorithm).

# D
- **DDD**: Domain-Driven Design — developing software centered on the business domain.
- **DIP**: Dependency Inversion Principle — both high-level and low-level modules depend on abstractions.
- **Domain**: The problem area a software system aims to solve.
- **Domain Event**: Object that represents a specific past event within the domain model.
- **Domain Model**: Abstraction representing key concepts, relationships, and actions within a business domain.
- **Domain Service**: Service performing business logic across multiple entities, encapsulating that logic.

# E
- **Entity**: Object with a unique identifier that maintains identity over time.
- **Event Storming**: Design methodology focusing on events to understand a business domain.

# F
- **Factory**: Encapsulation and abstraction pattern for object creation.

# G
- **Generic Subdomain**: Domain area handling generic functions used by many businesses (e.g., password encryption, user management).

# R
- **Repository**: Abstract layer that manages the persistence of an Aggregate.

# S
- **Service**: Object encapsulating business logic not tied to a specific entity or value object.
- **Strategic Design**: High-level approach to structuring large systems, managing complexity, and focusing on core domains.
- **Supporting Subdomain**: Subdomain essential to support the core domain but not a direct competitive differentiator.

# T
- **Tactical Design**: Detailed design approach for implementing domain models within individual bounded contexts.

# U
- **Ubiquitous Language**: Shared terminology used by domain experts, developers, and all team members.

# V
- **Value Object**: Object defined solely by its value, with no identifier; equality is determined by value.
