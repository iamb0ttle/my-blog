# 1. The Beginning — A Reckless Challenge from a Broke High Schooler

One day, I made up my mind:

> "Even though I have little money, I’ll build my own PaaS."

<br/>

The monthly cost of a cloud server felt too heavy.  
So I chose **a Raspberry Pi 4B (2GB RAM)** with a **64GB SD card**.  
In fact, it wasn’t brand-new — I bought it second-hand from a friend for **30,000 KRW (~$23)**.  
This tiny computer became my local data center, where I installed **K3s**, a lightweight Kubernetes distribution.

```bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
```

I created namespaces and connected my GitHub repository for GitOps.
At that point, I honestly thought: *Finally! I have my own PaaS.* 🤯

# 2. A Quick Detour — Kubernetes, K3s, and PaaS

While preparing for this project, I refreshed my understanding of Kubernetes fundamentals.

### Kubernetes Core Concepts

* **Cluster** — The entire environment where applications run, made up of multiple servers (nodes).
* **Master Node** — The brain of the cluster, responsible for scheduling, the API server, and overall state management.
* **Worker Node** — Where containers actually run, following the Master’s instructions.

Master and Worker Nodes can exist on the same machine or on separate ones.
**K3s** is a special case where the Master and Worker are combined into a single instance.

### Key Features of K3s

* A lightweight Kubernetes distribution, ideal for IoT and edge computing.
* Delivered as a single binary for extremely simple installation.
* **Supports combined Master + Worker node operation**, enabling the full Kubernetes experience on a single device.
* Perfect for local DevOps experiments and learning.

### What is PaaS (Platform as a Service)?

PaaS is a service model that lets developers deploy and operate applications without worrying about infrastructure.
It automates server setup, networking, and scaling so developers can focus entirely on writing code.

# 3. First Steps in Observability — Meeting Grafana

After finally setting up K3s, configuring Traefik for proper HTTPS, and confirming GitOps was working via FluxCD,
I moved on to what I believe is the most important part of service operation: monitoring.

Observability is crucial in any production environment.
So I installed **Prometheus + Grafana**.

```bash
helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
helm install grafana grafana/grafana -n monitoring
```

When the Grafana dashboard loaded in my browser, I felt truly proud.
Real-time graphs for CPU, memory, and network usage danced across the screen.

# 4. Reality Check — The Limits of a Raspberry Pi

It didn’t take long for reality to hit me.

* CPU usage was **always above 50%**.
* With only Grafana and Prometheus running, RAM usage hit **1.4GB out of 1.6GB**.
* The SD card I/O was constantly overwhelmed.

```bash
kubectl top nodes
```

The output from this command felt like my Raspberry Pi was crying out: *“Please… stop…”* 😭

# 5. The Decision — The Gap Between Ideals and Reality

At first, it looked amazing.
Running a K3s cluster at home, with GitOps and a full monitoring stack.
But reality was harsh.

* For a student, **cloud services were expensive**.
* Local hardware **wasn’t powerful enough**.

Without money, even DevOps feels out of reach… which is honestly depressing.

# 6. Lessons Learned

1. **Observability is essential** — Without Grafana, I wouldn’t have known when to make these decisions.
2. **Resources are not infinite** — RAM and I/O hit their limits faster than expected.
3. **Balancing ideals with reality** — Finding the sweet spot between cost and performance is where DevOps really begins.

# 7. Closing Thoughts

I’ve always been interested in container technologies,
but Kubernetes always felt like an unscalable wall.
However, after experiencing a small part of Kubernetes through K3s,
I feel like I’ve grown much closer to it.

Now, I’m more motivated than ever to study further.
And I’ve made a big decision — **I’m going to build a mini PC powerful enough to run Kubernetes smoothly**!
The purchase decision is already made in my heart. 🚀

P.S. One day, I’ll come back with a full K8s cluster and a rock-solid monitoring system. 😎
For now, my adorable Raspberry Pi 4B is happily running just a few containers. ^o^
Funny enough, after spending the whole weekend setting up K3s, I ended up going back to plain Docker…
