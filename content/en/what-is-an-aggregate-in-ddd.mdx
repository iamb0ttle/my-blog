# Overview
_This document summarizes the definition of an Aggregate in DDD._

# Introduction
The **Aggregate** is one of the core components of Domain-Driven Design (DDD). By using aggregates, we can manage domain objects more effectively, allowing developers to focus on building high-quality software.  
This document summarizes the definition of an aggregate to aid in understanding DDD.

# Aggregate
An **Aggregate** is a cluster of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit. Its primary purpose is to ensure consistent management across domain models, transactions, and related operations.

An aggregate has an entry point called the **Aggregate Root** â€” the root entity that external objects use to access elements inside the aggregate.  
All operations that modify the state of the aggregate must go through the aggregate root, ensuring that the root enforces consistency rules for the entire cluster.

# Final Thoughts
Through this, I have learned the definition of an aggregate and realized that the more effectively we group objects into aggregates, the greater the increase in development productivity.
